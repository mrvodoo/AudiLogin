Python Script to get acces tokens for the myaudi and VW Carnet Services

--I'm new to developing and Python so please excuse my beginner's "spaghetti" code ;)--

I'm using this auth script together with an openhab rule set to retrieve several information like mileage, gas and oil level or the next service intervals from my vehicle.
